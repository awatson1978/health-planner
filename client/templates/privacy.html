            <h5>Security of Your Personal Data</h5>
        <!-- not edited yet -->
            <p>Pentasyllabic Studios is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. On most of our sites, Pentasyllabic Studios enables the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. We also offer industry-standard secured-server transactions that encrypt your Personal Data when collecting your credit card information for online purchases. To verify that you have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window or the HTMLS-code in the site connection-identifier.

                Pentasyllabic Studios has implemented other industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Data. We store Personal Data behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. In addition, Pentasyllabic Studios protects your Personal Data from unauthorized physical access by storing your Personal Data in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, Pentasyllabic Studios limits access to Personal Data in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Pentasyllabic Studios’s organization who have a business need for such access.

                Even though Pentasyllabic Studios has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Pentasyllabic Studios cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.</p>
